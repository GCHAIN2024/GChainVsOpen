# GCHA.IN: Not just the Promotion Code, but the Promotion CHAIN.

GCHA.IN offers an innovative approach to website promotion using a multi-level referral system.
By employing a structured, hierarchical referral program, it motivates users to invite others, who then invite more users, fostering exponential growth. 
This creates a cascading network of referrals, driving traffic and engagement across multiple tiers.


### Website Integration for Business Owners:
As a website owner, you can integrate our service by embedding a simple JavaScript code. This allows your website users to share content via a sharing panel, similar to sharing through Google, Facebook, or Twitter.

### Unique Sharing Mechanism
Our platform differs from traditional social media. When users click the "Share via GCHAIN" button, the request is directed to our platform. We verify if the user is a registered active promoter, then generate a unique promotional hyperlink. This link contains both your website's content information and the promoter's details. Users can then share this hyperlink on other social media or send it directly to friends.

### For Influencers
If you're an influencer (e.g., a YouTuber) without technical control over your platform, you can still use our service. Simply copy the link you want to promote or use our browser extension. Once you have the target URL, follow the same sharing procedure by forwarding it to the GCHAIN platform.

### Referral Tracking and Commissions
Our platform automatically tracks referral relationships. When you introduce a new promoter, who then introduces another, and so on, we record this chain. If a promoter in your network shares a hyperlink that leads to a recorded content consumption or e-commerce purchase, contributing value to the business website, that website provides commission information to our platform. This commission is then automatically distributed proportionally through the referral hierarchy. 

### Passive Income Potential
As an effective promoter with numerous downstream promoters, their performance contributes proportionally to yours. This system allows you to earn passive income based on your network's overall performance.
